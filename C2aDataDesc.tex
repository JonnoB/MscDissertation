\chapter{Description of Data}
\label{DataDesc}


The data used in this project comes from the CLNR (Customer Led Network Revolution) \cite{customerlednetworkrevolution}, the UK's largest smart meter research project \cite{durhamenergyinstitutecustomerlednetworkrevolutiondurhamuniversity}. The goal of the project was to find applications of smart meters that will help move the UK towards a low carbon energy economy. The project was led by the Northern Power grid collaborating with Durham University, Newcastle University, British Gas and EA technology. The project was funded by Ofgem's (Office of Gas and Electricity Markets) LCN (Low Carbon Network) Fund. More than 13,000 customers took part in the project, the majority were British Gas customers, data included the use of low carbon technologies such as solar panels, electric vehicles and heat pumps. The data is broken into 9 Data sets described in table \ref{tab:datasets} this project uses TC1a "Basic profiling of smart meter customers".

The TC1a data set is comprised of 6 sub files the descriptions of which are found in table \ref{tab:TC1a}.  The dataset starts on 01-05-2011 and runs until 30-09-2013 the dataset is comprised of 8798 domestic electricity consumers whose homes are equipped with smart meters. For this work the key data set is "TrialMonitoringDataHH" which contains all the monitoring data, a detailed description of the data fields is shown in table \ref{tab:TrialDatadef}. Another important data set is "CustomerTestCellDefinition", which provides more detail on the customers; their tariff data, socio-demographic group, etc. Details on this data set can be found in table \ref{tab:CustCellDef}. It is important to note that the Trilliant and Logica smart meter providers measure time using different time zones, Logica uses GMT where as Trilliant uses Europe/London (UK local time). In this Project the Trilliant standard will be used as it reflects the as-experienced time of the user who will maintain the same local schedule (e.g Start work at 9am finish at 5pm). 

CLNR Note "...it is important to note that although the parameter type is thought to be energy consumption in 30 minute period, it is not clear exactly how it was calculated and what exact period this refers to. There is also the possibility that this parameter type is ‘average power [kWh]’.", In this project it will be assumed that the data reflects the 30 minutes in question and also reflects the total power consumption within that period, however it is expected that the data may be noisier than otherwise expected due to this data collection issue.
